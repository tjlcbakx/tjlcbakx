ALMA uncovers the [C II] emission and warm dust continuum in a z = 8.31 Lyman break galaxy</a></h5>
<i>2020: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 493, Issue 3, p.4294-4307</i> <br />
In this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02812.pdf">[pdf]</a>, we report on the emission of Carbon at redshift z = 8.3, and the non-detection of dust emission. To date, this is the most distant detection of Carbon, and together with the previously-observed Oxygen, we expect this galaxy to have an extremely hard radiation field, unlike galaxies at lower redshifts. The non-detection of dust suggests an unusually-warm dust component, perhaps due to the source's high redshift.

We report on the detection of the [C II] 157.7 μm emission from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) MACS0416_Y1 at z = 8.3113, by using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The luminosity ratio of [O III] 88 μm (from previous campaigns) to [C II] is 9.3 ± 2.6, indicative of hard interstellar radiation fields and/or a low covering fraction of photodissociation regions. The emission of [C II] is cospatial to the 850 μm dust emission (90 μm rest frame, from previous campaigns), however the peak [C II] emission does not agree with the peak [O III] emission, suggesting that the lines originate from different conditions in the interstellar medium. We fail to detect continuum emission at 1.5 mm (160 μm rest frame) down to 18 μJy (3σ). This non-detection places a strong limits on the dust spectrum, considering the 137 ± 26 μJy continuum emission at 850 μm. This suggests an unusually warm dust component (T > 80 K, 90 per cent confidence limit), and/or a steep dust-emissivity index (βdust > 2), compared to galaxy-wide dust emission found at lower redshifts (typically T ∼ 30-50 K, βdust ∼ 1-2). If such temperatures are common, this would reduce the required dust mass and relax the dust production problem at the highest redshifts. We therefore warn against the use of only single-wavelength information to derive physical properties, recommend a more thorough examination of dust temperatures in the early Universe, and stress the need for instrumentation that probes the peak of warm dust in the Epoch of Reionization.

A search for the lenses in the Herschel Bright Sources (HerBS) sample</a></h5>
<i>2020: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 493, Issue 3, p.4276-4293</i> <br />
In this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08373.pdf">[pdf]</a>, we perform a statistical method onto Herschel sources, comparing them to both optical and near-infrared galaxies. While the Herschel-objects themselves will most likely remain invisible in these optical and near-infrared observations, we attempt to find the foreground galaxies, that are the cause of the gravitational lensing inside many of these Herschel Bright Sources. We find that the optical observations do not have the depth to even find most foreground sources, but the near-infrared survey appears much more succesful. Finally, we measured for the first time the relationship between the flux of a source and it's probability to be gravitationally lensed; something that was suggested by models, but only now has been measured.

Verifying that sub-mm galaxies are gravitationally lensed requires time-expensive observations with oversubscribed high-resolution observatories. Here, we aim to strengthen the evidence of gravitational lensing within the Herschel Bright Sources (HerBS) by cross-comparing their positions to optical (SDSS) and near-infrared (VIKING) surveys, in order to search for the foreground lensing galaxy candidates. Resolved observations of the brightest HerBS sources have already shown that most are lensed, and a galaxy evolution model predicts that ∼76 per cent of the total HerBS sources are lensed, although with the SDSS survey we are only able to identify the likely foreground lenses for 25 per cent of the sources. With the near-infrared VIKING survey, however, we are able to identify the likely foreground lenses for 57 per cent of the sources, and we estimate that 82 per cent of the HerBS sources have lenses on the VIKING images even if we cannot identify the lens in every case. We find that the angular offsets between lens and Herschel source are larger than that expected if the lensing is done by individual galaxies. We also find that the fraction of HerBS sources that are lensed falls with decreasing 500-micron flux density, which is expected from the galaxy evolution model. Finally, we apply our statistical VIKING cross-identification to the entire Herschel-ATLAS catalogue, where we also find that the number of lensed sources falls with decreasing 500-micron flux density.

<h5><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473.1751B/abstract">Herschel Bright Sources (HerBS): Sample definition and SCUBA-2 observations</a></h5>
<i>2018: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 473, Issue 2, p.1751-1773</i> <br />
In this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01514.pdf">[pdf]</a>, we explore the brightest, distant galaxies found in the H-ATLAS survey. We define a sample, and provide its catalogue, together with observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.

<div id="text1345" style="visibility:hidden;"> <blockquote>We present the Herschel Bright Sources (HerBS) sample, a sample of bright, high-redshift Herschel sources detected in the 616.4 deg2 Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey. The HerBS sample contains 209 galaxies, selected with a 500 μm flux density greater than 80 mJy and an estimated redshift greater than 2. The sample consists of a combination of hyperluminous infrared galaxies and lensed ultraluminous infrared galaxies during the epoch of peak cosmic star formation. In this paper, we present Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) observations at 850 μm of 189 galaxies of the HerBS sample, 152 of these sources were detected. We fit a spectral template to the Herschel-Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and 850 μm SCUBA-2 flux densities of 22 sources with spectroscopically determined redshifts, using a two-component modified blackbody spectrum as a template. We find a cold- and hot-dust temperature of 21.29_{-1.66}^{+1.35} and 45.80_{-3.48}^{+2.88} K, a cold-to-hot dust mass ratio of 26.62_{-6.74}^{+5.61} and a β of 1.83_{-0.28}^{+0.14}. The poor quality of the fit suggests that the sample of galaxies is too diverse to be explained by our simple model. Comparison of our sample to a galaxy evolution model indicates that the fraction of lenses are high. Out of the 152 SCUBA-2 detected galaxies, the model predicts 128.4 ± 2.1 of those galaxies to be lensed (84.5 per cent). The SPIRE 500 μm flux suggests that out of all 209 HerBS sources, we expect 158.1 ± 1.7 lensed sources, giving a total lensing fraction of 76 per cent.<br /></blockquote></div>
